That is a fantastic roadmap! Transitioning from tutorials to building a functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application is the best way to make those concepts "stick."

Since you want to use your existing stack (Node, Express, EJS), we will build this using a **Server-Side Rendering** approach.

### 1. Project Initialization

First, set up your environment and install the necessary "ingredients."

1. **Create a folder:** `mkdir my-blog && cd my-blog`
2. **Initialize NPM:** `npm init -y`
3. **Install dependencies:** `npm install express ejs body-parser`
4. **Folder Structure:** Create a folder named `views` (for your EJS files) and a folder named `public` (for your CSS).

---

### 2. The App Architecture

Before coding, understand how the data flows. Since we are keeping it simple, we will store the blog posts in a **Local Array** (a variable) instead of a database for now.

---

### 3. Part 1: Setting up the Server (`app.js`)

Create an `app.js` file. This is the "brain" of your blog.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.static("public"));

// This is your temporary "Database"
let posts = [];

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.render("home", { posts: posts });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server started on port 3000");
});

```

---

### 4. Part 2: The View Layer (EJS)

Inside your `views` folder, create `home.ejs`. This will loop through your array and display the titles.

```html
<h1>My Blog</h1>
<a href="/compose">Write a New Post</a>

<ul>
  <% posts.forEach((post, index) => { %>
    <li>
      <a href="/posts/<%= index %>"> <%= post.title %> </a>
      <form action="/delete" method="POST" style="display:inline;">
        <input type="hidden" name="postIndex" value="<%= index %>">
        <button type="submit">Delete</button>
      </form>
    </li>
  <% }) %>
</ul>

```

---

### 5. Part 3: Creating Content (The "C" in CRUD)

You need a page to type your blog and a route to save it.

1. **The Route:** In `app.js`, add a GET route to show the form and a POST route to catch the data.
```javascript
app.get("/compose", (req, res) => {
  res.render("compose");
});

app.post("/compose", (req, res) => {
  const post = {
    title: req.body.postTitle,
    content: req.body.postContent
  };
  posts.push(post);
  res.redirect("/");
});

```


2. **The Form:** Create `compose.ejs` with an `<input>` for the title and a `<textarea>` for the content.

---

### 6. Part 4: Viewing and Deleting (The "R" and "D")

* **Viewing:** Use **Route Parameters** (e.g., `/posts/:id`) to find a specific post in your array using its index and render it on a `post.ejs` page.
* **Deleting:** The form we added in `home.ejs` sends the index of the post. In `app.js`, use `.splice()` to remove that item from the `posts` array.

```javascript
app.post("/delete", (req, res) => {
  const index = req.body.postIndex;
  posts.splice(index, 1);
  res.redirect("/");
});

```

---

### Why this works for you:

* **HTML/CSS:** You'll use this in your EJS files to make the blog look pretty.
* **Basic JS:** You're using arrays and objects to manage data.
* **Node/Express:** Handling the server logic and routing.
* **EJS:** Dynamically injecting your JS array into the HTML.

**Important Note:** Because we are using an array, your posts will disappear every time you restart the server. That is normal for this stage!
